====================
CountyTax:
Our project is to find the taxes of a state. We can  find the taxes by the use of sorting algorithms in our project. 
Sorting algorithms are used to make the the proper oreder by using the comparision between the elements.
There are different types of sorting algorithms, among them are:
Bubble sorting:
Bubble sorting is used to find the maximum element among all the elements. In this type the algorithm is used in which 
swapping occurs to make the proper order of the elements.
Selection sorting :
It is used to find the minimum among the elements. The algoritihm used in this type is to find the minimum and put it at the 
begining. The process continues till all the elemnts are sorted accoring to a proper order.
Insertion Sorting:
In this type the algorithm used is to find the minimum. In this type the array is splited into sorted and unsorted parts.
The elements from the unsorted part are selected by using algorithms and put at the right position in the sorted part.
Merge Sorting:
In this type the array is divided into two halves and then take it until one and then according to sorting it is put in the
the proper order by merging the elements.
Quick Soritng:
In quick sort we find an element as a piviot point. It may be the first element, last or middle. We can choose any one of 
these. Then we compare that piviot with its right and left elements and find the smaller and larger element from that.
The smaller are put at the left of that piviot and the larger are at the right side.
We have use all these sorting algorithms in our project to find the taxes of a state.
